Curve for which product of distance from point to 2 focal points is equal to length of focal point squared
### Formula $(x^2+y^2)^2=2f^2(x^2-y^2)$
- $f$: Focal point $x$ coordinate
> [!note] $f$ is typically $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$

### 2D Focal Point $|(x,y)-f||(x,y)+f|=|f|^2$
> [!note] This can further be simplified but for intuition I left it as is

> [!tip] If you do $|(x,y)-f||(x,y)+f|=|f|$
> It looks like two black holes are smoothly
> merging together into singularity
