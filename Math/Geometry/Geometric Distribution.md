Probability that $k$-th try was first successful result
### Formula $Pr(k)=(1-p)^{k}p$
- $p$ probability of success for each trial
> [!example] There is $60\%$ chance that drug will work on a patient
> Probability that 1st drug tried is the 1st sucessful one is $60\%$
> $2nd$ try has less chance since first try took $60\%$ out of $100\%$
> So it has $40\%*60\%=24\%$ 
> $3rd$ try has $40\%*40\%*60\%=9.6\%$
