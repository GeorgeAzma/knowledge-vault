focal distance / major axis $c/a$
 - $0$ circle `focus points are circle center, so distance is 0`
 - $0<e<1$ ellipse `focus point distance is smaller than major axis radius`
 - $1$ parabola `focus is same distance as directrix/major axis`
 - $e>1$ hyperbola `focus distance is  more than major axis`

### Formula $e=\huge\frac{\sin\beta}{\sin\alpha}$
- $\large r=\huge\frac{l}{1+e\cos\theta}$
