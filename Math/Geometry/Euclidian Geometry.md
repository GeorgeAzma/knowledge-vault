### Postulates
1. line segment can be drawn between any two points.
2. line segment can be extended indefinitely
3. circle can be drawn with any center and radius
4. all right angles are equal
5. **parallel postulate** if a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which the angles are less than two right angles `fails for hyperbolic space` 
### Formulas
$f+v=e+2$
- $f=\text{Faces}$
- $v=\text{Vertices}$
- $e=\text{Edges}$
