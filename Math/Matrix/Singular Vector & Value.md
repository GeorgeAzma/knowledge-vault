$AA_T,A^TA=S_L,S_R$
- [[Eigen Vector]][[s]] of $S_L,S_R$ are Left/Right Singular Vectors of $A$
- Square root of [[Eigen Value]][[s]] of $S_L,S_R$ are Left/Right Singular Values of $A$
If you sort Singular Values of $S_L,S_R$ by descending order
Their values are going to be identical
> [!note] 
> If $S_L$ dimension is higher then $S_R$ or vice-versa
> Then there is going to be leftover/unmatched
> sorted singular values and they are always 0
