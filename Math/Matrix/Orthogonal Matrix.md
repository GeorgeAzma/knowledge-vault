Normalized [[Symmetric Matrix]]
So visually it's like a rotated [[Identity Matrix]]
Multiplying vector with this rotates it
### Formula $AA^T=A^{-1}$
- [[Matrix Transpose|Transpose]] of an orthogonal matrix equals its [[Matrix Inverse|Inverse]]
- [[Matrix Transpose|Transposing/Inversing]] aligns orthogonal matrix to [[Standard Basis Vector|Standard Basis]]
