Normalized [[Symmetric Matrix]], so visually it's like a rotated [[Identity Matrix]]
multiplying vector with orthogonal matrix rotates it, so $\det(Q)=\pm1$
- Orthogonal matrix is real valued case of [[Unitary Matrix]]
### Formula $QQ^T=Q^TQ=Q^{-1}Q=I$
- [[Transpose|Transpose]] of an orthogonal matrix equals its [[Inverse|Inverse]]
- [[Transpose|Transposing/Inversing]] aligns orthogonal matrix to [[Standard Basis Vector|Standard Basis]]
