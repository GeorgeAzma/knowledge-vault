set that has [[Relation#Equivalence Relations|Reflexive, Antisymmetric, Transitive]] relation
like $\leq$ and similar ones like $\subseteq$
### Partial Ordering
not all elements are comparable
- $(\mathcal{P}(M), \subseteq)=\set{\set{1},\set{2},\set{1,2}}$
  $\set{1}\subseteq\set{1,2}$ but $\set{1}\not\subseteq\set{2}$ `{1} and {2} are not comparable`
- $(\mathbb{N},\mid)$ divisibility `[1,2,4,12,21] next elements are divisible by previous`
  `21 isn't comparable to 12, making it partially ordered set`
### Total Ordering
all elements are comparable
- $(\mathbb{R},\leq)$ leq relation `[1, 1.1, 2, 5], all elements are comparable`
