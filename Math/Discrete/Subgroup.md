Subset of [[Group]] that is also [[Group]]
> [!example] 
> - $\mathbb{Z}$ is a group, $\set{\mathbb{Z}\mid\mathbb{Z}\text{ is even}}$ is a subgroup
> - $\set{\mathbb{Z}\mid\mathbb{Z}\text{ is even}}$ is not subgroup, because $1+3=4$ `even`
### Lagrange's Theorem
- $H$ is [[Subgroup]], $G$ is [[Group]] $|H|\text{ divides }|G|$ `like even/odd divides by 2`
> [!example] $\mathbb{Z}_6$ has subgroups $\mathbb{Z}_1,\mathbb{Z}_2,\mathbb{Z}_3,\mathbb{Z}_6$, for prime subgroups only $\mathbb{Z}_1,\mathbb{Z}_p$ exist
- any prime order group is cyclic group
