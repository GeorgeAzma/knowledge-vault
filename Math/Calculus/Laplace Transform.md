### Formula $f(s)=\int_0^\infty x(t)e^{-s}dt$
- $\large s=\alpha+i\omega$
Like [[Fourier Transform|Fourier Transform]], but FFT only shows frequency composition
this also tells how exponential function is
e.g. If sine wave decays over time, it will show it as 2nd dimension $\alpha$
Positive $\alpha$ decays faster

`Useful for simplifying calculus into algebra (not sure how)`
