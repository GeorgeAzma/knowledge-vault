### $\Delta f=\nabla^2 f=\nabla\cdot\nabla f=\frac{\delta^2f}{\delta x^2}+\frac{\delta^2f}{\delta y^2}$
divergence of gradient ($\Delta$), so it's like how much gradient flows outwards/inwards
if it flows a lot you can imagine 2D function is similar to a bump
if it's close to 0, not much gradient so it's flat there
it's like `dFdx(dFdx(px)) + dFdy(dFdy(px))`
