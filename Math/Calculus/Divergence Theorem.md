divergence of entire volume = divergence of entire surface towards normal 
### $\int\int\int_V(\nabla\cdot F)dV=\int\int_{\delta V}F\cdot ndS$
- $V$ solid volume
- $\delta V$ surface boundry of volume
- $F$ a vector field `velocity, electric field, fluid flow...`
- $\nabla \cdot F$ divergence $F$ `how much it spreads out`
- $n$ outward-pointing unit normal vector on the boundary surface
- $dV$ small volume element
- $dS$ small surface element
