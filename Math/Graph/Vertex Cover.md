Set of vertices that contains every edge `at least one endpoint of every edge`
### KÃ¶nig's Theorem for Vertex Count
- For [[Bipartite Graph]][[s]] smallest vertex cover `==` [[Maximum Matching]]
  assuming only 1 endpoint of vertex cover is included
- For non-bipartite, smallest vertex cover `>=` [[Maximum Matching]]

If given minimum vertex cover `bipartite`, to find maximum matching
- first remove edges that have both end points included in vertex cover
- since minimum vertex cover exists, maximum matching also exists
