[[Graph]] or it's subset with every vertex pair connected

- **Maximal Clique** subsets of graph that are all cliques 
  where you can't add more vertices to any of the cliques while keeping them cliques
- **Maximum Clique** same as maximal clique, but with most clique subsets possible
### Finding Cliques
- **Tomita Algorithm**
- **Bron-Kerbosch Algorithm**
