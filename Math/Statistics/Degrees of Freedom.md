Number of variables you can change
> [!example] Point on a circle
> point has $x$ and $y$ location, but you can't directly change them
> If you want to follow a constraint of being on a circle
> instead you can change the angle, so it has $1DOF$ 

> [!example] Choosing which basket to put apple in from $n$ baskets
> For $n=1$ every apple has to go in 1 basket, you have no DOF
> For $n=2$ you can choose to put apple into 2nd basket, you have 1 DOF
> $DOF=n-1$
