Just an average 
> [!example] $[3, 5, 4] \to (3+5+4)/3$
### Formula $\large\mu=\large\frac{\sum x_i}{N}$
$\bar x=\large\frac{\sum x_i}{n}$ is sample mean `n is sample size`
### Geometric Mean $\large(\prod x_i)^{\frac1{n}}=\exp(\frac{\sum\log x_i}{n})$
### Harmonic Mean $\large\frac{N}{\sum x_i^{-1}}$
> [!example] Commonly used for rates and ratios
> If car travels $d$ at speed $60km/h$ 
> and returns to start at speed $20km/h$
> It didn't have average speed of $40km/h$
> Instead it's harmonic mean $30km/h$
> 
> Connecting $60\Omega$ and $40\Omega$ resistors in parallel
> gives resistance of $48\Omega$ which is harmonic mean
### Root Mean Square (RMS) $\large\sqrt{\frac{\sum x_i^2}{N}}$
`Also called quadratic mean`
### Generalized Mean $M_p=\large(\frac{\sum x_i^p}{N})^\frac1{p}$
- $M_{-\infty}$ is minimum element
- $M_{-1}$ is harmonic mean
- $M_1$ is geometric mean
- $M_1$ is arithmetic mean
- $M_2$ is root mean square
- $M_3$ is cubic mean
- $M_\infty$ is maximum element
