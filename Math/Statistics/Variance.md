### Formula $\text{var}(x)=\frac{\sum{(x_i-\mu)^2}}{N}$
- $\mu$ [[Mean]]
> [!note] sample variance is biased
> If you trying to approximate variance
> by randomly sampling the data portion
> then you should divide by $N-1$ instead of $N$,
> which gives better approximation
> this is called [[Bessel's Correction]]
### Pooled $var(x)=\sqrt{\frac{var(x_1)+var(x_2)+...+var(x_n)}{n}}$
Joined $var$ of 2 populations, when their mean is different
### Simplifications
- $\text{var}(ax)=a^2\text{var}(x)$
- $\text{var(a+b)}=\text{var}(a)+\text{var}(b)+2\text{cov}(a,b)$ [[Covariance]]
