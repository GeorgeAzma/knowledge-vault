like [[t-test]], but assumes [[Variance]][[s]] are known and sample sizes are large
> [!note] $n\geq30$ is typically considered large
### Formula $\huge\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$
- $x$ Observed value
- $\mu$ [[Mean]]
- $\sigma$ [[Standard Deviation]]
### [[p-value]] $1-\operatorname{erf}(\frac{z}{\sqrt2})$
chance of [[Normal Distribution|Standard Normally Distributed]] random value being outside $z$ 
used to test for outliers
- $z=0.5$ then $p=61.7\%$
- $z=1$ then $p=31.7\%$
- $z=2$ then $p=4.55\%$
- $z=3$ then $p=0.27\%$
