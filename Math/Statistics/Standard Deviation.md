### Formula $\sigma=\sqrt{\frac{\sum(x_i-\mu)^2}{N}}$
- $\mu$ [[Mean]]
> [!note] Other notations 
> - $\sigma$ standard deviation of population
> - $\sigma_x$ or $s$ or $SD$ standard deviation of sample
> - $\sigma_\bar{x}$ standard deviation of [[Mean]], which is called standard error
> - $\hat{\sigma}_\bar{x}$ standard error estimator
### Sample SD $s=\sqrt{\frac{\sum(x_i-\bar{x})^2}{n-1}}$
- $n$ sample size
- $\bar{x}$ sample [[Mean]]
Sample [[Mean]] is closer to samples, than population [[Mean]] would be
which means sample SD will be lower than population SD
to counter this divide by $n-1$ instead of $n$, this is called [[Bessel's Correction]]
### Pooled SD
Joined $\sigma$ of 2 populations, when their mean is different
- $\sigma=\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_1^2+\sigma_2^2+...+\sigma_k^2}{k}}$ `For equal sample sizes`
- $\sigma=\sqrt{\frac{(n_1-1)\sigma_1^2+(n_2-1)\sigma_2^2+...+(n_k-1)\sigma_k^2}{n_1+n_2+...+n_k-k}}$ `For different sample sizes`

> [!tip] $1\sigma$ from [[Mean]] has $68\%$ chance of being sampled
