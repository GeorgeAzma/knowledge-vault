Assumes no relation exists between 2 data sets being analyzed
Symbol for it is $H_0$

It's opposite is **Alternate Hypothesis** $H_a$ or $H_1$
> [!example]
> $\alpha=0.05$ `Critical Value`
> If [[p-value|p]]$>\alpha$ data sets are likely not related, so reject $H_a$
> If [[p-value|p]]$<\alpha$ data sets are likely related, so reject $H_0$
> 	
> $H_0$ Light color has no effect on plant growth
> $H_a$ Light color has effect on plant growth
> If $H_0$ is very unlikely ($<5\%$), you can decide to accept $H_a$
> ![[P-value.webp]]

> [!tip] there is [[p-value]] chance of $H_0$ being true and data having no relation
