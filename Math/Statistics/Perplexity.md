### $PP(p)=2^{-\sum_xp(x)\log_2(p(x))}=\prod_xp(x)^{-p(x)}$
From how many equally likely options or branches a probability model is choosing
For [[GPT|LLM]][[s]] lower perplexity means model is confident at next prediction

Like number of equally likely states, coin flip has $2$ states $PP=0.5^{-0.5}*0.5^{-0.5}=0.5^{-1}=2$
