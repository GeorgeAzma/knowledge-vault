Optimizing for functions for which local minima is global minima
- which means function is always going either only up or only down
- similar to convex polygon, if you shoot a ray at convex function
  it will only cross the function atmost twice
> [!example] finding valley of $x^2$ loss function
### Convexity Definition $f(\operatorname{mix}(x_1,x_2,\lambda))\leq\operatorname{mix}(f(x_1),f(x_2),\lambda)$
implies all lines made with 2 points on the function must always be above or on the function
> [!note] $-x^2$ is considered concave, because line is below the function `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
