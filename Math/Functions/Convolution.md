[[Cross-Correlation]] but the kernel is [[Matrix Transpose|transposed]]

> [!note] In Machine Learning, Convolution is usually equivalent to [[Cross-Correlation]]

> [!tip] Convolution of 2 signals $a(x)*b(x)=IFFT(A(x)B(x))$
> $A(x)B(x)$ are [[Fourier Transform]][[s]] product
> Also works other way around $a(x)b(x)=IFFT(A(x)*B(x))$
