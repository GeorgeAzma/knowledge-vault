### Formula $B(1+\frac{r}{n})^n$
- $B$ Base money `$1000`
- $r$ Annual interest rate `10%`
- $n$ Interest compound count `4`
> [!example] Deposit every 3 months for an year profit
> $n=4$ because there are 4 times 3 months in a year
> $1000(1+\frac{0.1}{4})^4\approx1103.81$, profit $\$103.81$

> [!example] Deposit every 3 months for an year, but keep the profit each time
> $1000(1+0.1)=1100$, profit $\$100$

> [!example] Deposit for an year, but $r=16\%$
> `since higher rates apply for longer deposits`
> $1000(1+0.16)=1160$, profit $\$160$ profit $\$160$

So best option is long term deposit
even if you try to redeposit every 3 months it's worse
