Like [[Moment of Inertia]] of a paddle wheel
it takes time for wheel to speed up/slow down
more [[Inductance]] is like heavier wheel

more [[Current]] means water hits the wheel more 
so it speeds up faster meaning inductance is lower
### Formula $L=\frac{\phi(I)}{I}$
- $I$ [[Electricity|Current]]
- $\phi(I)$ [[Magnetic Flux]] of $I$
