How much water would push you back if it hit you
water with high pressure/velocity or [[Voltage]]/[[Current]]
would push you back a lot
### Formula $P=IV=I^2R$
In Watts
- $I$ [[Current]]
- $V$ [[Voltage]]
- $R$ [[Resistance]]
### Heat $P=I\Delta V$
If you have a resistor resistance at one end 
would be much higher than other
meaning $\Delta V$ is high because $V=IR$ 
so it would produce heat
