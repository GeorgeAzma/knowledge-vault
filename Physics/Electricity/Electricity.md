Imagine electricity as water in 2D-ish container
- [[Charge]] is water molecule count
- [[Current]] is water molecules per second or velocity of water flow
- [[Resistance]] is tightness of the container
  tighter the container slower the flow so $I=V/R$
- [[Voltage]] is slope of water, like [[Derivative]] of water height
  higher the slope faster the flow so $I=V/R$
- [[Physics/Electricity/Power]] is how much water would push you back if it hit you
  water with high pressure/velocity or [[Voltage]]/[[Current]]
  would push you back a lot so $P=IV$
- [[Inductance]] paddle wheel spin rate determines water velocity
  or [[Current]], [[Inductance]] is like moment of [[Angular Momentum|Inertia]] of the wheel
  it takes time for wheel to speed up/slow down
  more [[Inductance]] is like heavier wheel
- [[Capacitance]] all above are water surface phenomenon
  [[Capacitance]] is like water below the surface that doesn't move
