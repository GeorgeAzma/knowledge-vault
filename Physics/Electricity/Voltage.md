Like pressure of water and height in gravitational [[Potential Energy]]
### Formula $V=IR$
- $I$ [[Current]]
- $R$ [[Resistance]]
> [!tip] 
> $I$ is how many electrons pass in a second
> and $V$ is like pressure, if there is a lot of resistance,
> but still a lot of electrons pass through, that means
> there must be a lot of pressure or voltage
### Unit $V=\large\frac{J}{C}$
`energy per charge`
- $J$ [[Joule]]
- $C$ [[Charge|Coloumb]]
