**Permeability means ease of passing through**, for water it would measure ease of passing through the pipes, for electricity it measures ease of passing through certain materials and it's relative to permeability of vacuum
## Relative Permeability $\mu_r=\mu \div \mu_0$
- $\mu$ Material permeability
- $\mu_0=\huge\frac{2 \alpha h}{e^2c}=\normalsize1.25663706212\times10^{-6}NA^{-2}$ Vacuum Permeability
How easily can $a$ flow through $b$ compared to how easily $a$ can flow through empty space
> [!example] relative permeability of 2 means it's twice as hard to flow through given material than through empty space
### [[Electricity]] $\mu=1/R$
- $R$ [[Resistance]]
