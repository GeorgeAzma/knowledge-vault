### Formula $\huge q_1q_2\over 4\pi\epsilon_0 r^2$
- $q_1,q_2$ particle charges
- $\epsilon_0$ [[Vacuum Permittivity]]
- $r$ distance between particles

This formula tells repulsion strength between 2 particles,
so if $q_1$ is negative and $q_2$ is positive (electron, proton), repulsion strength would be negative, meaning they attract each other.
### Electric Field Formula $\vec E(\vec r)=\large \frac{q\vec r}{4\pi\epsilon_0|\vec r|^2}$
$4\pi\epsilon_0=1.1126500564\times10^{âˆ’10}$
