Temperature at which air has $100\%$ humidity
If cooled further water vapor will condense as water
### Approximation $DP=\large\frac{243.12\alpha}{17.62-\alpha}$
- $\alpha=\ln(RH)+\large\frac{17.62T}{243.12+T}$
- $RH$ [[Humidity]]
- $T$ temperature
> [!example]  Air with $70\%$ humidity at $15\degree C$
> reaches $100\%$ humidity at $9.57\degree C$

> [!tip] Use it to calculate when cold windows start having droplets
