Energy required to heat up 1 gram of water by 1$C\degree$
a.k.a. water's [[Specific Heat Capacity]] which is $4.186J/gÂ°C$
### Calorie $4.186J$
> [!note] 
> Human needs ~$2000kcal$ per day
> which is energy required to boil 
> 20 liters of freezing water
> 
### Calculating Calorific Value
- Calculated using a bomb calorimeter
	![[Bomb Calorimeter.webp]]
- Fuel is placed in water
- Water is placed in adiabatic container (like thermos)
- Initial water temperature is recorded
- Fuel is burned
- Final water temperature is recorded
### Calorific Value Formula $4.186m_wT_d/m_f$
- $4.186$ water's [[Specific Heat Capacity]]
- $m_w$ Water's mass
- $T_d$ Initial/Final water temperature delta
- $m_f$ Fuel's mass
