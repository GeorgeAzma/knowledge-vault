Typical ratio `Cₓ(H₂O)ₓ`
- **monosaccharide** sugar that cannot be [[Hydrolisis|hydrolysed]] to give a simpler sugar. `glucose, fructose, galactose` 
- **disaccharide** has 2 monosaccharides `sucrose = glucose + fructose, lactose = glucose + galactose` 
- **polysaccharide** has multiple monosaccharides `starch, cellulose`
