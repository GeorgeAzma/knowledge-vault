In covalent [[Bond]][[s]] electrons are shared, but atoms may have uneven [[Electronegativity]] `electron greed`
so more electronegative atom pull electrons stronger making them **partially negative (δ–)**
while making less electronegative atom **partially positive (δ+)**
**partial** meaning fraction of the electron is pulled towards more electronegative atom `not full ±1`

#### [[Dipole]] Example `H2[δ+] — O[δ–]`
`O` is more electronegative than `H` so electrons are pulled toward it
- `O` has `δ– ~0.66` partial charge
- `H` has `δ+ ~0.33` partial charge
