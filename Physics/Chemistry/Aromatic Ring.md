- **Ring of carbons** `usually 6`
- **Alternating double bonds** `or delocalized electrons over the ring`
- **Planar structure**
- **High stability** compared to non-aromatic rings
### Examples 
benzene `C₆H₆`, written as `Ph`
        phenyl `C₆H₅-`, similar principle as [[Alkyl]][[s]] but for benzene instead of carbon

### Hückel’s Aromaticity rules
1. **Cyclic** molecule must form a ring
2. **Planar** atoms in the ring must lie roughly in the same plane
3. **Conjugated π system** ring must have alternating single and double bonds `or a continuous overlap of p-orbitals`
4. **Hückel rule** ring must have **4n+2 π electrons** `where n = 0,1,2…`, this explains stability
- `Benzene` has 6 π electrons → satisfies 4n+2 with n=1 → aromatic
- `Cyclobutadiene` has 4 π electrons → 4n rule → **antiaromatic**, unstable.
