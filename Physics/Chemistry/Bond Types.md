- **Sigma Bonds (σ)** 
    - 1st bond between any 2 atoms
    - strong bond
    - sigma bond can rotate
- **Pi Bonds (π)**
    - 2nd/3rd bond in double/triple bonds
    - no rotation `it would break π bond`
    - weaker bond `less orbital overlap`
    - **Side-by-side overlap** of p orbitals, **perpendicular to bond axis**.
**C-C** single bond → 1 σ
**C=C** double bond → 1 σ + 1 π
**C≡C** triple bond → 1 σ + 2 π `top/bottom lines`
