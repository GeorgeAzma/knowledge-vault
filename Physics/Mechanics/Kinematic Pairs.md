### Types
- **Lower**: Surface area contact
- **Higher**: Point/Line contact
- **Wrapping**: Like higher pair but has multiple point contacts
- **Open**: Contact via external force like gravity (e.g. Spring)
- **Closed**: Can break contact by destroying one of the elements
- **Sliding**: Having slide relative motion (e.g. Piston)
- **Turning**: Having turning relative motion (e.g. Motor)
- **Rolling**: Having relatively rolling motion (e.g. Ball Bearing)
- **Screw**: Having turning+sliding motion (e.g. Nut-bolt)
> [!note]
> All lower pairs are closed pairs
