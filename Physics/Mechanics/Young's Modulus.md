### Formula $E=\huge\frac\sigma\epsilon$
- **Stress** $\sigma=\large\frac{F}{A}$ internal force per unit cross-sectional area
- **Strain** $\epsilon=\large\frac{\Delta L}{L_0}$ material deformation relative to it's original length
	- $\Delta L,L_0$ change in length and original length
### Unit [[Pascal]]

> [!example] 
> - Rubber band stretches linearly as force is increased
> > [!note] 
> > As rubber band stretches it's cross sectional area decreases
> > which makes it easier to stretch, so as force is increased
> > rubber band may stretch more and more in reality
> > > [!note] Stress is internal force **per unit area** so it takes this into account
> - After force reaches **Yield Strength** it starts to permanently deform
> - After force reaches **Ultimate Strength** it starts to stretch and break
>   by itself (as long as force is maintained)
> - Finally it reaches **Fracture** point where rubber band breaks
### Young's Modulus for Materials
- **Steel** 190-215 GPa
