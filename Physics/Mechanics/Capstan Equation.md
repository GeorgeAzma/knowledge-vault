### Formula $T_{hold}=\large\frac{T_{load}}{e^{\mu\theta}}$
- $\mu$ friction coefficient
- $\theta$ circumference that rope touches
![[Capstan Equation.webp]]
Lifting with a rope that lays on the wheel is easier
because of friction, more wrapped arund the rope
is and more friction there is, easier it is to lift
> [!note] Works for multiple wraps
