Measure of radiant flux weighted by [[Luminous Efficiency]]
### Formula $I_v(\lambda)=683.002lm/W\bar{y}(\lambda)I_e(\lambda)$
- $I_v(\lambda)$ Luminous intensity `in candelas`
- $\lambda$ [[Light|Wavelength]]
- $\bar{y}$ Luminous efficiency function
- $I_e(\lambda)$ Radiant intensity
> [!note] Source radiating $1W$ of light in [[Luminous Efficiency|Most Intense Color]] ($555nm$) has 683 [[Lumen]][[s]]

> [!example] Bulb has $1700lm$
> If it's radiated equally in all directions
> So over $4\pi$ [[Steradian]][[s]] or surface area of a sphere
> Then $I_v=\frac{1700lm}{4\pi sr}\approx 135lm/sr=135cd$
> 
> If it's focused into $20\degree$ beam (0.095 [[Steradian]][[s]])
> It would have intensity of $\approx 18,000cd$ within the beam
