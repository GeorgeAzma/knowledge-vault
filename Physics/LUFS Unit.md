Human perceived loudness depends on [[Sound]] amplitude/frequency
So you can't measure loudness using [[Decibel]][[s]]
because it doesn't consider wave frequency 
**LUFS** unit does and it's used for measuring sound loudness
### Amplitude/Frequency Relation To Loudness
Red curve is where perceived loudness is the same

> [!tip] Humans perceive 2000-5000hz the loudest
