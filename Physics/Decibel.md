### Formula $L=10\log_{10}{\frac{I}{I_0}}$ dB (SIL)
- $I_0$ Reference intensity `in watts per meter^2`
> [!note] There are different types of dB
> - Sound pressure level (SPL) $20\log_{10}{\frac{p}{p_0}}$ `p is pressure`
> - Sound intensity level (SIL) $10\log_{10}{\frac{I}{I_0}}$
> - [[Voltage]] level $10\log_{10}{\frac{V}{V_0}}$
> - Power level $10\log_{10}{\frac{P}{P_0}}$ `P is power`
> - Gain $10\log_{10}{\frac{P_{out}}{P_{in}}}$ `P is power`
> - Attenuation $10\log_{10}{\frac{P_{in}}{P_{out}}}$ `P is power, equals negative Gain dB`

> [!note] Usually set to lowest human ear can hear (at $1000hz$) $10^{-12}W/m^2$
> > [!tip] Equivalently $10\log_{10}(I)-120$
### Decibel Chart

| 20 | $10^{-10}$ | Whisper from meter distance |
| 30 | $10^{-9}$ | Quiet home |
| 40 | $10^{-8}$ | Average home |
| 50 | $10^{-7}$ | Average office |
| 60 | $10^{-6}$ | Conversation |
| 70 | $10^{-5}$ | Busy traffic |
| 80 | $10^{-4}$ | Loud radio |
| 90 | $10^{-3}$ | Inside heavy truck `Damage if prolonged exposure` |
| 100 | $10^{-2}$ | Siren `Damage if 8h a day` |
| 110 | $10^{-1}$ | Loud chainsaw `Damage if 30min` |
| 120 | $1$ | Loud rock concert `Threshold of pain` |
| 140 | $10^2$ | Jet 30 meters `Severe pain, damage in seconds` |
| 160 | $10^4$ | Bursting of eardrums |
