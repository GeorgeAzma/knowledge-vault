### Formula $d=\frac{I}{Mh}$
- $d$ distance from COP to pivot
- $I$ [[Moment of Inertia]] of object around pivot
- $M$ mass
- $h$ distance from center of mass to pivot
> [!example] Uniform rod [[Pendulum]] $M=1,l=1,I=\large\frac{ml^2}{3}$
> $\large d=\huge\frac{1^2}{3*0.5}\large=\huge\frac{2}{3}$
> Strike the rod at $2/3$ length from pivot to feel least jerk

If you hold a heavy metal rod with 2 fingers
and let it fall on another metal rod perpendicular to it
it might slip out of your fingers
**COP** is the point where it would slip the least

- If you rod **hits close to your fingers**
  then it will slip up from your fingers
  because of momentum of rod far from fingers
- If rod **hits at the end** that object will kinda
  become the new pivot making the rod
  rotate downwards from your fingers
- If rod **hits at COP** momentum of rod
  from COP towards away of your fingers
  and momentum of new pivot cancel out
