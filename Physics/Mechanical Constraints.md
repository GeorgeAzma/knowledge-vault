### Types
- **Holonomic**: circle rolling technically has 2 [[Physics/Degrees of Freedom]] (rotation and x position) but it's x position is proportional to rotation, so you can eliminate one of the variables, this is called Holonomic constraint
- **Non Holonomic**: Circle rolling on a rough non flat surface, because it has 3 [[Physics/Degrees of Freedom]] (x, y position and rotation), you can't determine x,y position by rotation because you don't know surface height map
- **Rheonomic**: Time dependent
- **Sleronomic**: Time independent

- **Kinematic**
- **Geometric**
- **Dynamic**
- **Loading**
- **Control**
- **Path**
