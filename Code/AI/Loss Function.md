- $MAE/L1=|x-y|$ Mean Absolute Error
- $MSE=(x-y)^2$ Mean Squared Error, favors large number of small errors 
  than small number of large errors
- $RMSE=\sqrt{(x-y)^2}$ Root Mean Squared Error, same as $MSE$
    But easier to read for humans
> [!note] Probability vector is often calculated using [[Softmax]]
