Add extra dimension that arranges data such that they are more separable by line/plane
If you have 2 colored concentric circles they aren't separable by plane
but if you add 3rd dimension of distance from center $z=x^2+y^2$
then it becomes separable by a plane, even if it's a bad at [[Classification]]
it simplifies the problem and you can feed the simple problem to [[Neural Network]]
