##### My Tests
1. Decide randomly to go left or right, see if it gives gaussian curve
2. Each bit has 50/50 chance of being 0 or 1
3. Each byte has uniformly distributed chance of being in a bucket 0-255
4. Mean is $\frac{MAX-MIN}{2}$ and Standard deviation is $\frac{MAX}{2}$
- Chi-Squared or kolmogorovâ€“smirnov test for 1, 2 and 3
