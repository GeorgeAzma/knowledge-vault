smooth low-discrepency dithering pattern
``` c
ign = frac(52.9829189 * frac(dot(uv, vec2(0.06711056, 0.00583715))))
```
### Awesome Property
individual pixel values when scrolling the pattern linearly each frame is also low-discrepency
so this pattern is **low-discrepency over space and time** `wow`
