    return mix(12.92 * rgb, 1.055 * pow(rgb, vec3(1.0 / 2.4)) - 0.055, step(0.0031308, rgb)); 
}

}

> [!note] sRGB uses `2.4` gamma but people say monitors have `2.2` gamma
> since sRGB contains linear segment and non-linear segment with gamma of `2.4`
> overall better approximation of gamma is closer to `2.2` because of linear-segment

> [!note] `lrgb2srgb = srgb encode` and `srgb2lrgb = srgb decode` typically
