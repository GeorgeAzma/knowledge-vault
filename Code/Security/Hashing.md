aliases:
  - Message Digest
---
- Converts variable size input into fixed size hash 
  that can't be converted back into original input
- Same data generates same hash
- Hash of a whole message is called **Message Digest**
- Hash can be used for data validation
  by checking if sent data and delivered data has same hash
### Hashing Algorithms
- [[SHA256]] `secure`
- SHA512 `secure`
- BLAKE `fast`
- xxHash `fast`
- CRC32 `kinda fast, low collisions`
- md5 `insecure, slow`
> [!tip] 
> Hashing can be used for fast [[Transport Layer Security (TLS)#Purpose|Authentication And Integrity]]
> See [[Message Authentication Code (MAC)]] for more info

> [!note] 
> - This also does **authentication** as side effect,
> because if hashes generated by client and server match
> that means server and client both have the same keys
> which means they are actualy who they say they are
> - Message+Key should be hashed in same order 
>   `Hash(Key + Message) != Hash(Message + Key)`
