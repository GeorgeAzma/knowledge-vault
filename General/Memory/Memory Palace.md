Place filled with things like [[Person Action Object (PAO)]]
that you can walk and remember things in order as you walk
### Constructing Memory Palace
- Imagine a familiar location
- Imagine a path you should walk
- Burn that location and path in brain by walking back and forth in it mentally
- Imagine $n$ amount of distinct locations on your path where you can place objects
- Place objects following the path (for example if you are trying to remember chemical elements place water in the first location to be reminded that first element in the chemical element table is hydrogen, then place helium balloon in the second location etc.)
### Tips
- Exaggerate objects, for example if you are imagining a knife, imagine someone getting stabbed etc.
- Walk on easy path `e.g. clockwise`
