	  色+も+鮮やか＋だ -> color + also + vibrant + is
	   花+が+綺麗+**で**＋香り＋も+とても+**よくて**＋色＋も＋鮮やか＋だ
	   "The flowers are beautiful, the scent is great, and the colors are vibrant"

	   removed extra だ and only placed it at the end
- **食べる+の+が+好き+だ** => to eat + (join) + (subject) + like + is

> [!example] Saying "Water was drunk by a dog"
> `水が犬にのまれた (mizu ga inu ni nomareta)`
> - `mi-zu` is "water", `ga` marks it as **subject**
> - `i-nu` is "dog", `ni` marks it as **actor**
> - `no-ma` is "drink" with `a` stem
> - `re-ta` is past tense of `re-ru`, which is **receptive** suffix

> [!example] Saying "I was not made to drink something"
> - Start with verb "drink" `no-mu 飲む` (drink is now a subject)
> - Make "drink" causitive `no-mu -> no-ma-se-ru 飲ませる`
>   because drink/subject is making me do something
> - Make it receptive `no-ma-se-ru -> no-ma-se-ra-re-ru 飲ませられる`
> - Make it negative `no-ma-se-ra-re-ra-naーi 飲ませられらない`
> - Make it past tense `no-ma-se-ra-re-ra-na-ka-t-t-a 飲ませられらなかった`
