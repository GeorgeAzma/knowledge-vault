### Tips
- freqs should't mix, so reduce `bass` component from `main` and `secondary
- use chord progressions for `main` and `secondary`, chords should have `mid` freq
- carve `mid` freqs from everything else to leave space for `main` or `secondary`
- don't play `main` and `secondary` together, use `counterpoint, fills, response`
- you can have multiple instruments playing same notes, use `bright` and `dark` instruments
- add reverb to `non-main` instruments to push it to background
- introduce instruments gradually
