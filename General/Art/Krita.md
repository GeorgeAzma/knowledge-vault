### Improvements I Want
- changing colorize mask palette color changes all strokes with same color
- rename dockers `to avoid very long names taking up tab space (Wide Gamut Selector)`
- remove whitespace on top of `Wide Gamut Selector`, along fg/bg switcher
- sensor curves similar to shader graph, sometimes I want curves to depend on each other or have some complex relationship, krita's sensor curves aren't advanced enough for this
- better color blend mode and filter UI + search 
  `too many dropdowns are hard to navigate, blend modes go outside screen`
- transform tool should work for colorize mask
- more modern UI design
- theme browser
